# Pomodoro

A configurable study timer application built using `React`. Utilizes React lifecycle methods to handle asynchronous events in order to manage state. `Web-workers` run Javascript in the background without interfering with the user interface to prevent browser idle state.

### The Study Method

A time management technique that splits 25 minute work intervals, called pomodoros, with small break sessions in between.
